# Readable

This project is created for Udacity's React Nanodegree.

This is a content and comment web app. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that is originally included in the starter codes.

## Start the app

- Install and start the API server first:
  - `cd api-server`
  - `yarn`
  - `node server`
- In another terminal window, install and start the front-end React app:
  - `cd readable`
  - `yarn`
  - `yarn start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
